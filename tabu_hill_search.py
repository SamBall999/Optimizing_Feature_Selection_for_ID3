# Feature selection in classication can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem.
# High number of features complicates the learning of the model, and, as a result, makes dicult the correct prediction of new observations.
# Feature selection problem in classification can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem because
# (i) consists of choosing a subset of features among N (2N possible subsets exist)
# (ii) because the quality of a subset may be evaluated (by the quality of the classification model constructed with this subset, for example) - is this the performance on the test or validation data?

# NB are we maximizing or minimizing?
# Motivate all design decisions
# NB to understand what search space looks like cost we can have any combination of features
# our problem is combinatorial and discrete since two classes A and B?? is this true?



# Design decisions
# 1. How to encode problem/solution
# 2. How to define neighbourhood
# 3. What to use as fitness function??



# ENCODING PROBLEM
# Each solution is encoded as a bitstring of length no_features
# Each bit in the bit string indicates whether that features is chosen or not

# calculates fitness of current position
# we want to find the set of features which allows ID3 to obtain the best generalization ability.
# therefore do we use accuracy on the validation set?? (recall test set must in no way be used to create the model)
# i.e. given a candidate subset x -> build model using training set and evaluate accuracy on validation set and use this as fitness??
# NB rather make training and validation data global??

    # convert from string to array if it is not in array form?
